# To Do List

A basic to do list app that can be used to maintain some tasks that you wish to perform.
Enter the task, click add to add a new item.
To delete the the task (When you've done it or plan on skipping it :P) just click the task.

##You can use the following commands to start the project:

###`npm install`

To install all the dependencies required.

###`npm start`

To start the react app and start using the to do list :)
